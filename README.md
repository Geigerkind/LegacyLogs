# LegacyLogs
This is a reupload of an old project, about 3 years ago, which converted DPSMate dump files to raid logs and armory pages for World of Warcraft Vanilla, TBC and WOTLK.

This project has been abondoned because of its inprecision and unscalability.
It has been rewritten in C++ and C# in its upgrade project https://legacyplayers.com

Nevertheless, feel free to roam in this repository.
